注：本次作业由于输出结果并不确定，需要重点进行特殊情况示例来判断是否存在考虑不全的情况(见部分二)。
一、情况示例(普通程序，非优化程序)

Please enter the number of elevators: 3
Please enter the length of the simulation (in time units): 10

//Now, the actual simulation will occur, although this does not need to be printed.
//To show the queue, we will use the notation (source, destination, time entered) to show requests
//The fronts of the queue is to the left and the rear is to the right
//Elevators have the notation [Floor X, state, request_being handled]
Step 1: A request arrives from Floor 6 to Floor 1
	 //The 1 elevator was idle, so it starts moving towards the source floor
Requests: (6,1,1)
Elevators: [Floor 2, TO_SOURCE, (6,1,1)][Floor 1, IDLE, ---][Floor 1, IDLE, ---]



Step 2: A request arrives from Floor 10 to Floor 3
	 //The 2 elevator was idle, so it starts moving towards the source floor
Requests: (10,3,2)
Elevators: [Floor 3, TO_SOURCE, (6,1,1)][Floor 2, TO_SOURCE, (10,3,2)][Floor 1, IDLE, ---]



Step 3: A request arrives from Floor 2 to Floor 8
	 //The 3 elevator was idle, so it starts moving towards the source floor
Requests: (2,8,3)
Elevators: [Floor 4, TO_SOURCE, (6,1,1)][Floor 3, TO_SOURCE, (10,3,2)][Floor 2, TO_DESTINATION, (2,8,3)]



Step 4: A request arrives from Floor 8 to Floor 1

Requests: (8,9,6)
Elevators: [Floor 5, TO_DESTINATION, (6,1,1)][Floor 6, TO_SOURCE, (10,3,2)][Floor 5, TO_DESTINATION, (2,8,3)]



Step 7: Nothing Arrives
Requests: (8,9,6)
Elevators: [Floor 4, TO_DESTINATION, (6,1,1)][Floor 7, TO_SOURCE, (10,3,2)][Floor 6, TO_DESTINATION, (2,8,3)]



Step 8: A request arrives from Floor 3 to Floor 9
Requests: (3,9,8)
Elevators: [Floor 3, TO_DESTINATION, (6,1,1)][Floor 8, TO_SOURCE, (10,3,2)][Floor 7, TO_DESTINATION, (2,8,3)]



Step 9: A request arrives from Floor 8 to Floor 4
	 //The 3 elevator was idle, so it starts moving towards the source floor
Requests: (8,4,9)
Elevators: [Floor 2, TO_DESTINATION, (6,1,1)][Floor 9, TO_SOURCE, (10,3,2)][Floor 8, TO_SOURCE, (8,1,4)]



Step 10: A request arrives from Floor 3 to Floor 8
	 //The 1 elevator was idle, so it starts moving towards the source floor
Requests: (3,8,10)
Elevators: [Floor 1, TO_SOURCE, (1,2,5)][Floor 10, TO_DESTINATION, (10,3,2)][Floor 7, TO_DESTINATION, (8,1,4)]
